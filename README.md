A repository containing a bunch of [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) plugins made by NorthWestWind.

# Installation
This only works on Unix systems currently. The scripts aren't too complicated, so if you want to run this on Windows, you may try to port the shell scripts to batch.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `package.sh`. (If you get permission error, run `chmod +x package.sh`, and run it again.)
3. Navigate to the `build` directory. The `.mbp` files are located there.
4. Profit.

# Usage

## Color
- `!color random` - Returns a random color.
- `!color show <hexColor>` - Preview the given color.

## Splatoon3
- `!splatoon3` - Shows you the current rotation.
